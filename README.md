# :cocktail: :clinking_glasses: :wine_glass: :tropical_drink: :tumbler_glass:

This is a project to recognize the type of bar glass from a picture.

### Project steps:

  1). Images were downloaded from Google using Python and Selenium Webdriver, placed into separate folders.
  
  2). Images were selected, cropped, unnecessary removed, changed to square shape.
  
  3). Test, validation and train datasets were organized, images renamed.
  
  4). Image classifier (convolutional neural network, functional way, using  tensorflow, keras) was built.
  
  5). 5. Model has been evaluated, confusion matrix has been plotted
          
        Results:
      - train dataset: loss 0.0513, accuracy: 0.9791
      - validation dataset: loss 0.1250, accuracy: 0.9677
       -test dataset: loss 0.1584, accuracy: 0.9624
